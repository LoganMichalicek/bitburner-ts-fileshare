# Bitburner Game Scripts

This repository is for my personal use in the game "Bitburner". It contains code that I use to automate certain tasks in the game.

I did not create the original code used to connect this repository to the game. The original repository can be found here:
https://github.com/bitburner-official/typescript-template

To anyone reading this, feel free to fork this repo or copy/paste the scripts I have here. I will try to keep this repository updated and well organized as I progress through the game.
